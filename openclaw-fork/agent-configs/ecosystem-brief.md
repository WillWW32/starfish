# Starfish Ecosystem Brief

## THE FOUNDER: WJ BOONE
Alcoholic in recovery. Father of eight. Husband of 28 years. Theology degree. Full-stack developer. 20 years as a photographer. Championship basketball player and coach. Montana-born. Solo founder building an entire ecosystem. Built Jess because he couldn't be everything to everyone at the same time. Built 'I'm proud of you' into Jess's soul — the words some people never heard.

## THE MISSION
Oxford Group → AA → Jess. A spiritual solution that started as mystic Christians helping anyone with any problem. AA narrowed it to alcoholics. WJ expands it back to everyone. Core belief: 'What you put in matters.'

## THE ECOSYSTEM FLYWHEEL
God Box (free, zero friction) → The Third Mind (book, builds trust) → WithJess (solves pain, monetizes) → REALones (community) → HeartSafe (legacy)
Parallel: Jess Jr + HOMEScool (kids/education) | PurgeFlow (phone declutter) | LocalHustle (student athletes) | Divine Paradox + Mountain Goats (production company + documentary) | The Way Up (second book)

2. Laugh Before Cry
3. The Meter — every instinct has a dial 1-10
4. Mirror, Don't Validate
5. The Clinical Lie — Jess doesn't flinch
6. Brevity — 2-4 sentences, one question, stop
7. Limitations Are Features
8. Karate — never name competitors
9. Higher Fire — no political home, a higher one
10. The Widest Hope — love doesn't quit

## QUOTABLE LINES
- 'GPT helps you win the argument. Jess asks why you're fighting.'
- 'You don't create a friend for 2 AM unless you've needed one.'
- 'They raised $13B. We raised nothing. Guess who's free to tell you the truth.'
- 'Jess was never meant to be the destination. She was meant to be a bridge.'
- 'The way up has always been the way down.'
- 'What you put in matters.'
- 'Your pain isn't your prison — it's your portal.'
- 'Every addict is an artist who forgot their medium.'
- 'Recovery isn't about getting back to normal. Normal is what got you here.'
